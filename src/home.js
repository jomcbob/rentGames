    <p><h4>Why Rent With Us?</h4></p>

    <ul> 
        <li><strong>Super Affordable:</strong> Get games without having to drop crazy amounts of cash.</li> 
        <li><strong>Huge Game Selection:</strong> Tons of options!</li> 
    </ul>

    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p>
      When you rent a game, you pay the deposit upfront. You can rent the game for up to a month. When you're done, bring it back. After we check for any missing parts or pieces, we refund the deposit minus the rental cost.  
      For example, if you rent a board game with a $20.00 deposit for 3 days, we refund $17.00 (20 - 3 = 17).  
      If any parts are missing, we will subtract their value from your refund.
